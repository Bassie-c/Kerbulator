Kalculator
==========

Kalculator is a mod for [Kerbal Space Program](http://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com) (KSP). It adds a powerful calculator you can use during flight. It allows you write mathematical functions, execute them and create maneuver nodes based on the results. It uses an expression language which is unicode aware, so your formulae can be a little more readable than traditional programming code.

Kalculator comes without any preprogrammed formulae. While it can be fun to use [someone else's math](https://github.com/MuMech/MechJeb2), the point of Kalculator is to enable you to learn and discover on your own.

What you get is access to all the numbers you can read off the various displays in vanilla KSP and a simple expression language to write functions operating on them. This enables you to use them to calculate useful stuff like Hohmann transfers, gravitational slingshots, launch windows, etc. Kalculator can also create maneuver nodes for you based on your calculations.
