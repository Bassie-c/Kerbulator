# Given
GM = 3.986005E14
a = (6378.14 + 400) × 1000
A = 2 × 4
m = 1000
C_D = 2.67
ρ = 2.62E-12
H = 58.2

V = √(GM/a)

Δa_rev = (-2 × π × C_D × A × ρ × a^2) / m
ΔP_rev = (-6 × π^2 × C_D × A × ρ × a^2) / (m × V)
ΔV_rev = (π × C_D × A × ρ × a × V) / m
L = -H * 1000 / Δa_rev 

Δa_rev = round(Δa_rev, 1)
ΔP_rev = round(ΔP_rev, 4)
ΔV_rev = round(ΔV_rev, 5)
L = round(L, 0)
